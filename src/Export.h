//   RAW    the bytes as they are.
//   DUMP   a hex dump in the layout of xxd, sixteen bytes a line with their
//          offset, readable in any terminal and turned back into the bytes
//          by `xxd -r` or by tools/ttl_receive.py. Lines beginning with '#'
//          carry the block number and a CRC-32.
//   IHEX   Intel HEX, sixteen bytes a record, each record with its checksum.
//          Any hex tool reads it.
//
// The link is one way, so nothing can be acknowledged and sent again. What
// there is instead is a CRC-32 (the one of zip and zlib) of what was sent,
// shown on the screen, to be compared with the CRC-32 of what arrived.
//
// A buffer can go out in blocks, so that one that arrived damaged can be
// sent again on its own.
