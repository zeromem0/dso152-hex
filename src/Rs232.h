// Recovering an RS232 byte stream from ADC samples of the BNC input, with
// nothing told to it in advance: neither the speed nor the frame shape.
//
// Speed comes from the shortest run of samples at one level. In 8N1 traffic
// that is one bit time, and a start bit on its own already provides one, so
// a single character is often enough.
//
// The frame shape is settled by elimination. Every candidate -- seven or
// eight data bits, no parity or even or odd, one or two stop bits -- is
// checked against each character seen, and any whose stop bit lands on a
// space, or whose parity does not add up, is struck out. What survives in
// order of preference is the answer. The order matters for one case only:
// with the line idle between characters a second stop bit cannot be told
// from idle, so one stop bit is preferred, and two is reported only when the
// traffic is back to back and the longer frame is the one that fits.
//
// Levels: a line at rest sits at mark, the negative one. Through a non
// inverting front end that is the lower count, so `inverted` is true by
// default and a logical one is a count below the threshold.
